# Team Allocator
## Python tool that picks teams randomly.

### How it works
This project uses Python's `random` module to form teams with randomly selected players.  I use lists to store player's names.

The `random` module will shuffle this list into a different order.  Loops will be used to iterate through the list and display the players.

I then use an if statement to check to see if user is happy with the selection.
